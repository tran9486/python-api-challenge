The range of latitude does not stretch all the way from -90 to 90. This is likely because there are no cities above 80 degrees or below 75 degrees latitude.

Temperature seems to have the strongest correlation to distance from the equator as compared to humidity, cloud cover, or wind speed.

There is more variation in temperature in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere. This may be because the land mass distribution on Earth skews towards the North.
